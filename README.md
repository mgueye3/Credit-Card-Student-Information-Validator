# Credit Card & Student Information Validator

## Description

This project provides a Python script that performs three essential functions:

1. **Credit Card Type Identifier** - Determines the type of credit card based on user input.
2. **Student Classification System** - Identifies a student's academic year and major based on a provided encoded input.
3. **ISBN-10 Checksum Generator** - Validates and generates an ISBN-10 checksum digit for a 9-digit input.

This project is ideal for a **Software Development Apprentice** as it demonstrates basic input handling, data validation, and conditional logic in Python.

## Features

- Identifies major credit card types (Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club, Discover, American Express).
- Converts a coded student classification input into meaningful information.
- Ensures ISBN-10 validity by computing its checksum.
- User-friendly input prompts and error handling.
- Simple, modular, and extendable Python script.

## How to Use

1. Run the script using Python.
2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - `1`: Identify Credit Card Type
   - `2`: Classify Student Year and Major
   - `3`: Generate ISBN-10 Checksum
3. Follow the on-screen instructions for input.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit_card_student_validator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
